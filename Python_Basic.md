# Python Tutorial

# Python basic:

## Python Comments:

1. Single Line Comments
    
    ```python
    #This is a comment
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    
2. Multiline Comments
    
    ```python
    """
    This is a comment
    written in
    more than just one line
    """
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    

## Python Variables:

### Variables:

1. Creating Variables
    
    ```python
    x = 5 # x is of type int
    y = "John" # y is of type str
    print(x) 
    print(y)
    ```
    
2. Casting
    
    ```python
    x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
    y = int(3)    # y will be 3
    z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
    ```
    
3. Get The Type
    
    ```python
    x = 5
    y = "John"
    print(type(x))
    print(type(y))
    ```
    
4. Single and Double Quotes
    
    ```python
    x = "John"
    # is the same as
    x = 'John'
    ```
    
5. Case-Sensitive
    
    ```python
    a = 4
    A = "Sally"
    #A will not overwrite a
    ```
